&ensp;For the Anomaly Detection component, the presented version is merely an explorative solution to better grasp what the module's purpose is and how it should attempt to label data.
<br/>
&ensp;At this point, we do not know how the fully processed data will look like, thus we can only approximate what our anomaly detector should do.
<br/>
&ensp;As further research regarding the aforementioned module, we fould some interesting resources:
