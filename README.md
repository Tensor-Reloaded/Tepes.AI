## 2.Work

### 2.1 Laboratory 1
 - ‚úÖ Build teams, find research coordinator and identify the theme of the project.

### 2.2 Laboratory 2
 - ‚úÖ Configure [Github](https://github.com/Tensor-Reloaded/Tepes.AI) or Bitbucket or ... and Trello or ... for each project appropriate to master
page from which you belong. Use meaningful names for the project and the steps you take.
The results for themes from Lab 2 must be added on portal. Specify what everyone does in a
separate [file](txt-files/laboratory2-responsabilities.txt) type ‚Äú.txt‚Äù. Also create a file with following information: project name,
members names, the coordinator, contact information, etc..
 - ‚úÖ On the theme set by the scientific coordinator you make the [state-of-the-art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7tl5RLEwBVzp951lLt35fuOIm2RMJpEmJc_y_Fz06U) (a document
(1/2 pages per team member), which to put on GoogleDocs/GitHub/Bitbucket/etc., in
English with):

### 2.3 Laboratory 3
 - üöß On the theme set by the coordinator perform requirements analysis, a document which will be added on
the portal in English describing the major components will be available in the application that you make.
Important: This document will describe all the application you would have to do, specifying what
components will be implemented by the end of this semester. In determining the score will take into
account the complexity of Requirement analysis, the correct identification of possible actors and how to
make use case scenarios.
 - üöß Using the document made at Problem 2 create two [diagrams](diagrams) by each team member (UML). (All names will
be in English). Class diagrams and use-case diagrams are mandatory. In determining the score will take into
account the correct identification of elements and correlations between them. One person from the team
will coordinate the team and he will know what was done by each team member and he will make a short
presentation to the lab coordinator. Also this person will establish and negotiate points that deserve each
team member
